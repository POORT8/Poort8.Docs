# 3: Customer Journeys

NoodleBar's implementation follows several customer journeys to ensure a seamless and structured approach to setting up and managing a dataspace. These journeys guide users through the process of initiating a dataspace, onboarding data sources, and enabling data providers and consumers to become independent contributors.

### 3.1 Initiating Dataspace Core

The first step in setting up a dataspace is to initiate the Dataspace Core. This involves:

- **Setting Up the Organization Register**: Establishing a central repository for managing organizational identities.
- **Configuring the Authorization Register**: Defining and enforcing access control policies.
- **Launching the Dataspace Manager**: A web application for managing dataspace standards, including authentication, onboarding requirements, and data models.

### 3.2 Onboarding Data Sources

After setting up the core, the next step is to onboard data sources:

- **Registering Data Providers**: Adding organizations that will provide data.
- **Integrating Data Sources**: Using Dataspace Adapters to convert legacy APIs and ensure data compatibility with the dataspace schema.
- **Defining Access Policies**: Setting up rules and permissions for data access through the Authorization Register.

The process of registering data providers and defining access policies using the Core Manager is shown in the [NoodleBar Showcase](10%20-%20NoodleBar%20Showcase.md).

### 3.3 Onboarding Data Owners and Consumers

To fully operationalize the dataspace, onboard data owners and consumers:

- **Adding Data Owners**: Organizations that control data sources and define access conditions.
- **Registering Data Consumers**: Entities that will access the data provided.
- **Configuring Access Controls**: Ensuring proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.

### 3.4 Data Sources Becoming Independent

As the dataspace matures, data sources can become independent:

- **Developing Independent Solutions**: Data providers can create their own solutions, reducing reliance on Dataspace Adapters.
- **Enhancing Integration**: Continued support for interoperability and compliance with dataspace standards.

### 3.5 Adding Providers and Apps

Finally, expand the dataspace by adding more providers and apps:

- **Onboarding New Service Providers**: Integrating additional data sources and services.
- **Launching New Applications**: Developing and deploying new apps that leverage the dataspace for enhanced functionality and user experience.

### 3.6 Customer Journeys Summary

- **Initiating Dataspace Core**: Set up foundational components and management tools.
- **Onboarding Data Sources**: Register and integrate data providers and sources.
- **Onboarding Data Owners and Consumers**: Add and configure entities for data access and control.
- **Data Sources Becoming Independent**: Enable data providers to develop independent, compliant solutions.
- **Adding Providers and Apps**: Expand the dataspace with new services and applications.

These customer journeys provide a clear roadmap for setting up and managing a dataspace, ensuring that all participants can collaborate effectively while maintaining data sovereignty and compliance.
