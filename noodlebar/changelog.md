# Weekly Changelog

## 2026-03-27 — Keyper default workflow + onboarding PDF fix

### Dataspace API

**Fixed**
- `POST /api/onboarding` now correctly validates PDF files submitted as `BusinessRegisterExtract`. Previously, valid PDF files could be incorrectly rejected due to a stream positioning issue during header validation. [#801](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/801)

### Keyper API

**Added**
- A new generic English-language workflow `keyper.default@v1` is now available. Pass `keyper.default@v1` as `orchestration.flow` in `POST /api/approval-links` to use a standard dataspace approval flow without a dataspace-specific customization. [#817](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/817)

## 2026-03-20 — Multi-country organization registration + onboarding contract changes

The onboarding endpoint now supports Dutch, Belgian, and German organizations, with live registry verification for each country. This release contains two breaking changes to `POST /api/onboarding` — existing integrations must update before upgrading.

### Dataspace API

**Breaking**
- `POST /api/onboarding` now requires `multipart/form-data` encoding instead of JSON, a new required `CountryCode` field (`NL`, `BE`, or `DE`), and renames `KvkNumber` to `BusinessRegisterNumber`. Update your `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data`, add `CountryCode: NL` for Dutch registrations, and rename the field in your payload. [#762](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/762)
- `POST /api/onboarding` now requires phone numbers in international E.164 format (e.g., `+31612345678`). Numbers in local format (e.g., `0612345678`) are rejected with a validation error. Add the country dialing prefix to your phone number value. [#786](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/786)

**Added**
- `POST /api/onboarding` now accepts Belgian organization registrations. Set `CountryCode` to `BE` and provide a KBO number as `BusinessRegisterNumber`. The KBO number is verified against the official Belgian business registry — a `KboCheck` verification record is created during provisioning. [#762](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/762) [#768](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/768)
- `POST /api/onboarding` now accepts German organization registrations. Set `CountryCode` to `DE`, provide a commercial register number as `BusinessRegisterNumber` (HRB format, e.g., `HRB12345`), and optionally supply a court code in the new `RegistrationCourt` field. The organization's LEI is looked up automatically via the GLEIF registry. [#789](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/789)
- `POST /api/onboarding` now accepts an optional `BusinessRegisterExtract` field — a PDF upload of the business register extract. [#762](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/762)
- `POST /api/onboarding` now accepts an optional `Vat` field for the organization's VAT number. [#785](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/785) [#789](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/789)

**Changed**
- `POST /api/onboarding` now returns 400 when the submitted `CountryCode` is not accepted by this dataspace instance. [#770](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/770)
- Belgian organizations onboarded via `POST /api/onboarding` now receive a `VatCheck` verification record during provisioning. The VAT number is automatically derived from the KBO number and verified against the EU VIES service. [#785](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/785)

### Keyper API

**Changed**
- Users who authenticate successfully but are not authorized to approve for their organization now see a dedicated error screen, rather than being redirected back to the authentication step. [#715](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/715) [#763](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.Private/pull/763)
